### Project Topic:
Make BlackParrot work with varying L1 i-cache sizes and associativities, including 32 KB/8-way, 16KB/4-way, 8KB/2-way, and 4KB/1-way.

#### I have defined a new set of parameters in the top level aviary called icache_lce_sets and icache_lce_assoc. To use them in any file then you need to just put in the param icache_*_p. I have already defined these in the icache file (The origional one not the _v2 one), the fe_mem file, and bp_fe_top.

#### To make the i-cache working well in different way associativitiy with still receiving 512 bits packet from CCE, a struct called bp_fe_vaddr_s in /bp_fe/src/include/bp_fe_mem_defines.vh is redifined. (The bit-width of offset is modified.)

#### Using counter to stall extra cycles and add a buffer to keep the data/tag data for extra cycle so that 512 bits data can be written into different way set associative correctly.

#### And the benefit for this scheme is only 8/icache_assoc_way more cycles will be added for each instruction load.
