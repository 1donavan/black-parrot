Description:
This tag is the latest attempt at testing the Py-H2 verification flow with a subset of BlackParrot.
The goal was to test if the automated testcase shrinking feature of hypothesis is able to parse the
complexity of a multicore system.

Latest update:
This integration was attempted at POSH 6/18 and resulted in a minimal demo of an ALU verification.

Next tasks:
Testing with the latest versions of both BlackParrot and the Py-H2, both of which have evolved
significantly since this attempt
