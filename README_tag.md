Description: This tag is the branch from when BlackParrot was used as class material in UW EE 477
(course material found at bjump.org/vlsi).  Dozens of students hacked on BlackParrot to improve PPA
and ideas from several of the branches were eventually pulled into mainline.  This tag is unlikely
ever to be used for development, but it is a notable release.
