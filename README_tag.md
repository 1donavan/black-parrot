Description: This tag is the latest attempt at integrating BlackParrot into OpenPiton. The basic
idea is to remove coherence from the base BlackParrot and entirely rely on OpenPiton for all cache
operation.

Latest update: This integration was attempted at POSH 1/2020 and successfully ran hello world and
riscv tests on BlackParrot within the OpenPiton infrastructure.

The latest version of this is being worked on in a mainline branch in a much less hacky way.
